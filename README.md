GLAAS provides policy- and decision-makers at all levels with reliable,
easily accessible, comprehensive data on water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) systems, including on governance, monitoring, human resources and
finance. GLAAS monitors elements of WASH systems that are required to
sustain and extend WASH services and systems to all, and especially to
the most vulnerable population groups.
